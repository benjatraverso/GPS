Arduino + GPS
- Get data block from GPS
- Print data in correct types on serial monitor

Arduino (SLV) + Arduino (MSR) with I2C handshake
- Turn Led on/off on master depending on SLV's pushbutton's state

Arduino (MSR) + Arduino (SLV) + GPS
- Print data blocks received from SLV through I2C bus to Serial Monitor

Arduino (SLV) to board
- Same as previous but with SLV in a board as standalone chip
(atmega as a serial to I2C interface with GPS)
